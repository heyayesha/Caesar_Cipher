//Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. 
//Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet.
// In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y, and z would map to z, a, b and c. 
//Code the Caesar Cipher in Javascript and submit it here.
